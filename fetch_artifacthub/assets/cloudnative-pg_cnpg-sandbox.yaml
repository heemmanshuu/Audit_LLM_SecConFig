                          them), DataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates
                          an error if a disallowed value is specified. (Beta) Using

                          user-initiated actions such as debugging. This list cannot
                          be specified when creating a pod, and it cannot be modified
                          by updating the pod spec. In order to add an ephemeral container
                          to an existing pod, use the pod's ephemeralcontainers subresource.
                          This field is beta-level and available on clusters that
                          haven't disabled the EphemeralContainers feature gate.

                            be restarted when they exit or when a Pod is removed or

                                is primarily informational. Not specifying a port
                                here DOES NOT prevent that port from being exposed.

                                is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3
                                to become 2/2/2; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would
                                make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1).

                                5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains),
                                so \"global minimum\" is treated as 0. In this situation,
                                new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,

                                is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate
                                MaxSkew. \n This is an alpha field and requires enabling

                                We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try
                                to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. We

                                Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose
                                nodes match the node selector. e.g. If TopologyKey
                                is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain
                                of that topology. And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone",

                                is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector

                                satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster

                                            are two important differences between
                                            DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While
                                            DataSource only allows two specific types
                                            of objects, DataSourceRef allows any non-core
                                            object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                            objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                            values (dropping them), DataSourceRef
                                            preserves all values, and generates an
                                            error if a disallowed value is specified.
